## Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles:

1. **Presentation Layer** (UI)
   - Screens and components
   - Provider state management
   - UI-specific logic

2. **Domain Layer** (Business Logic)
   - Models
   - Use cases
   - Repository interfaces

3. **Data Layer**
   - Repository implementations
   - Data sources
   - External services

## Key Features

- Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, Analytics)
- Location services
- File handling and media management
- Clean state management with Provider
- Modern UI components
- Error handling and crash reporting
- Local data persistence

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   dart pub run build_runner build -d
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `config.env.example` to `config.env`
   - Fill in required API keys and configurations

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Style**
   - Follow Flutter's official style guide
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Write clear documentation for complex logic

2. **State Management**
   - Use Provider for state management
   - Keep providers focused and single-responsibility
   - Avoid provider nesting when possible

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for business logic
   - Include widget tests for UI components
   - Maintain good test coverage

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize image and asset loading
   - Use const constructors where possible
   - Implement proper error handling
